Some institutions, such as StarMine (ThomsonReuters), rank financial analysts based on EPS and target price accuracy. These rankings are published and are relevant: stocks favored by top ranked analysts will probably receive more attention from investors. Therefore, there is a growing interest in understanding the relative performance of strategies based upon analysts with different forecast accuracy.

We use the Black-Litterman model. The views are TP or EPS rank-weighted means of analysts forecasted returns. We developed simulations of trading strategies using different information sets to compute the ranks. If we consider that only the information known prior to time $t$ is used to obtain the ranks, investors would be better off following the strategy that weights more heavily the estimates issued  by the most accurate TP forecast analysts and considering the whole performance tracking record of the of the analysts.


For future work we will developed new methods to forecast analysts rankings so as to get closer to the upper bound of perfect foresight of rankings.



In this paper we presented an adaptation of the naive Bayes algorithm for label ranking that is based on similarities of the rankings taking advantage of a parallel that can be established between the concepts of likelihood and distance. We tested the new algorithm on label ranking datasets and conclude that it consistently outperforms a baseline method and is competitive with the state-of-the-art.

A number of issues remain open, which we plan to address in the future. Firstly, we are currently working on creating new datasets for ranking applications in different areas, including finance (e.g., predicting the rankings of the financial analysts based on their recommendations). These new datasets will enable us to better understand the behavior of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we assume that target rankings are total orders. In practice, this is often not true~\citep{cheng2010,brazdil2003}. We plan to address the problem of partial orders in the future.  Finally, we plan to compare the new method with existing ones.


Some institutions, such as StarMine, rank financial analysts based on their accuracy and investment value performance. These rankings are published and are relevant: stocks favored by top-ranked analysts will probably receive more attention from investors. Therefore, there is a growing interest in understanding the relative performance of analysts. Typical approaches are based on individual characteristics of those analysts or past analyst forecasting accuracy. Here, we follow an alternative approach that links the general behavior of rankings of analysts to variables that explain the uncertainty and information asymmetry on analyst-specific, stock-specific, and macroeconomic levels.

We introduce a new approach, based on the naive Bayes Label Ranking algorithm, in identifying the discriminative power of a variable; thus,  its contribution to the rankings conditional on different states of the world: static state, first-difference, random part of time-series decomposition, and sliding standard deviation.

We report that for the analysts- and stock-specific variables, the uncertainty about future stock performance is the most contributive to the changes in rankings. The macroeconomic variables influence rankings the most considering all variables at once.

For the future work we would like to take the findings of this paper and apply them to the problem of predicting the actual rankings of the analysts.

In this paper we show that it is possible to model analysts' rankings and variables that affect them. With recent findings from Machine Learning body of research in label ranking, we adapted the algorithm to predict the rankings of financial analysts based on price targets and EPS forecasts. We report that, in case of price targets,  our predicted rankings are more accurate than those obtained from using information of  the whole history of analysts performance. For the rankings based on EPS forecasts, our model is able to predict rankings that are better than those of the \default{} and the \naive{} baselines. Moreover, the supremacy of our model above the baselines occurs when  the variables that characterize analysts' information environment exhibit a stationary behavior expressed as the first-difference.

We also performed a back-test of active trading using the predicted rankings as inputs for the Black-Litterman model. The results showed that the strategies based on the analysts' rankings outperform, in terms of the annualized cumulative return, a  strategy based on the analysts' consensus. Of the ranking based trading strategies, the maximum annualized cumulative return yields  a strategy that is based on the predicted rankings with the first-difference of state variables.

The results of our work open many opportunities for future research. For example, in this paper we use the classical interpretation of the Black-Litterman model where risk is measured as a standard deviation. Recent work suggests utilizing more complex measures such as value-at-risk and high-moments approaches.



In this thesis we achieve multiple goals. First we show that rankings of financial analysts are important to investors as a trading strategy based on the rankings outperforms the ones that are based on the consensus or a buy and hold strategy. Second, we adapt the label ranking algorithm to map the rankings with the variables that affect these rankings (state variables) and, further, we identified a set of variables that affect the rankings the most. Finally, we successfully predict the rankings and we show that a strategy based on the predicted rankings outperforms the baselines. 

Our work has the following limitations. First, our ranking model of financial analysts does not take into consideration analysts' verbal recommendations about a stock. In our work we assume that by setting an upward (downward) price target an analyst signals a ``buy" (``sell") recommendation for investors. It would be interesting to incorporate all three components of analysts' report (explicit stock recommendations, EPS forecasts, and price targets)  into a single ranking and apply models developed in this thesis.  Second, we select a naive Bayes label ranking algorithm to predict the rankings mainly due to the Bayesian framework used in  the Black-Litterman model. For the future work, we may extend the analysis to other label raking models, such as the nearest neighbor or association rules. Finally, our work could be applied in different ranking domains; for example, predicting the rankings of mutual funds based on their annual performance.
