\vspace*{10mm}
I thank my advisors, Carlos Soares and Ana Paula Serra, for their support and exceptional guidance. Their insightful ideas and helpful discussions are invaluable and greatly acknowledged.  I also thank Pavel Brazdil, Luis Torgo, Alipio Jorge, Germ√°n Creamer for their comments and suggestions.

Any written acknowledgment is not enough for the love, patience and understanding of my wife, my parents, and my children. I hope that I made all of you proud.
