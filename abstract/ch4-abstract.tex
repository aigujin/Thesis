Financial analysts are evaluated based on the value they create for those who follow their recommendations. Some institutions use these evaluations to rank the analysts. Predictions of the most accurate analysts are  typically modeled in terms of individual analyst's characteristics. The disadvantage of this approach is that these data are hard to collect. In this paper, we follow a different approach in which we characterize analysts' relative performance  on the basis of state variables rather than individual characteristics.  We apply a  label ranking model to predict the rankings and use them to develop active trading strategies. The results show that it is possible to accurately model the relation between selected attributes and rankings of analysts. In addition,  the strategy based on the predicted rankings  applied to the S\&P500 stocks  generates higher returns than that based on the analysts' consensus.
