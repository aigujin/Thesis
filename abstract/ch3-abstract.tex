The prediction of the most accurate analysts is typically modeled in terms of individual analyst characteristics. This approach has its disadvantage that these data are hard to collect and often unreliable. We follow a different approach in which we characterize the general behavior of rankings of analysts based upon state variables rather than individual analyst characteristics or past accuracy. We use a Machine Learning label ranking algorithm that we adapt to model the relation between the selected variables and the rankings. By calculating a ranking-based discriminative power, we show that the uncertainty about future stock performance influences the rankings of the analysts while the macroeconomic variables have the most contribution to the changes in rankings.
